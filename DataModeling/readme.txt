This package contains the Mice Protein Expression Data Set Notebook in ipynb format, Report and Presentation slides.
The results obtained in the notebook for KNN and Descion Tree are not based on set random seed and may vary when you rerun each time.


QUICK START:

The code for this assignment is developed in jupyter notebook (in Anaconda) and tested to run in any iPython interactive environment in Jupyter Notebook.
This project is using datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mice+Protein+Expression)
to identify proteins critical to learning ability of Down syndrome mouse model.
